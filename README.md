> Filter tests using substring

```shell
# run only tests with "hello" in their names
npx cypress run --env grep=hello

  âœ“ hello world
  - works
  - works 2 @tag1
  - works 2 @tag1 @tag2

  1 passing (38ms)
  3 pending
```

All other tests will be marked pending, see why in the [Cypress test statuses](https://on.cypress.io/writing-and-organizing-tests#Test-statuses) blog post.

If you have multiple spec files, all specs will be loaded, and every test will be filtered the same way, since the grep is run-time operation and cannot eliminate the spec files without loading them.

## Install and use

Assuming you have Cypress installed, add this module as a dev dependency

```shell
# using NPM
npm i -D cypress-grep
# using Yarn
yarn add -D cypress-grep
```

**required:** load this module from the [support file](https://on.cypress.io/writing-and-organizing-tests#Support-file) or at the top of the spec file if not using the support file.

```js
// cypress/support/index.js
// load and register the grep feature
// https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-grep
require('cypress-grep')()
```

**optional:** load and register this module from the [plugin file](https://on.cypress.io/writing-and-organizing-tests#Plugins-file)

```js
// cypress/plugins/index.js
module.exports = (on, config) => {
  // optional: register cypress-grep plugin code
  // https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-grep
  require('cypress-grep/src/plugin')(config)
}
```

The plugin code will print a little message on load, for example

```shell
$ npx cypress run --env grep=hello
cypress-grep: only running tests with "hello" in their names
```

## Filter by grep

You can use any way to modify the environment value `grep` except the run-time `Cypress.env('grep')` (because it is too late at run-time). You can set the `grep` value in the `cypress.json` file to run only tests with the substring `@smoke` in their names

```json
{
  "env": {
    "grep": "@smoke"
  }
}
```

You can also set the `env.grep` object in the plugin file, but remember to return the changed config object:

```js
// cypress/plugin/index.js
module.exports = (on, config) => {
  config.env.grep = '@smoke'
  return config
}
```

Most likely you will pass the grep string via CLI when launching Cypress

```shell
$ npx cypress run --env grep=@smoke
```

### AND tags

Use `+` to require both tags to be present

```
--env grep=@smoke+@fast
```

### Invert tag

You can skip running the tests with specific tag using the invert option: prefix the tag with the character `-`.

```
# do not run any tests with tag "@slow"
--env grep=-@slow
```

### OR tags

You can run tests that match one tag or another using spaces. Make sure to quote the grep string!

```
# run tests with tags "@slow" or "@critical" in their names
--env grep='@slow @critical'
```

## Tags in the test config object

Cypress tests can have their own [test config object](https://on.cypress.io/configuration#Test-Configuration), and when using this plugin you can put the test tags there, either as a single tag string or as an array of tags.

```js
it('works as an array', { tags: ['config', 'some-other-tag'] }, () => {
  expect(true).to.be.true
})

it('works as a string', { tags: 'config' }, () => {
  expect(true).to.be.true
})
```

You can run both of these tests using `--env grep=config` string.

### TypeScript users

Because the Cypress test config object type definition does not have the `tags` property we are using above, the TypeScript linter will show an error. Just add an ignore comment above the test:

```js
// @ts-ignore
it('runs on deploy', { tags: 'smoke' }, () => {
  ...
})
```

## Test suites

The tags are also applied to the "describe" blocks with some limitations:

- you can only use the config object tags

```js
describe('block with config tag', { tags: '@smoke' }, () => {
})
```

- currently only the invert tag to skip the blog has meaningful effect. For example you can skip the above suite of tests by using `--env grep=-@smoke` value. Keep an eye on issue [#22](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-grep/issues/22) for the full support implementation.

See the [cypress/integration/describe-tags-spec.js](./cypress/integration/describe-tags-spec.js) file.

## General advice

- do not use spaces in the tags themselves, as `--env grep=...` string separates the grep string into OR tags using the space ` ` separator.
- I like using `@` as tag prefix to make the tags searchable
- I like using the test or suite configuration object to explicitly list the tags

```js
// âœ… good practice
describe('auth', { tags: '@critical' }, () => ...)
it('works', { tags: '@smoke' }, () => ...)
it('works', { tags: ['@smoke', '@fast'] }, () => ...)

// ðŸš¨ NOT GOING TO WORK
// ERROR: treated as a single tag,
// probably want an array instead
it('works', { tags: '@smoke @fast' }, () => ...)
```

## DevTools console

You can set the grep string from the DevTools Console. This plugin adds method `Cypress.grep` to set the grep string and restart the tests

```js
// use grep "@tag1"
Cypress.grep('@tag1')
// run the test with substring "hello world"
// without parsing separate words as tags
Cypress.grep(['hello world'])
```

- to remove the grep string, enter `Cypress.grep()`

## Debugging

This module uses [debug](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug#readme) to log verbose messages. To enable debug console messages, from the DevTools console set `localStorage.debug='cypress-grep'` and run the tests again.

## Migration guide

### from v1 to v2

In v2 we have separated grepping by part of the title string from tags.

**v1**

```
--env grep="one two"
```

The above scenario was confusing - did you want to find all tests with title containing "one two" or did you want to run tests tagged `one` or `two`?

**v2**

```
# enable the tests with string "one two" in their titles
--env grep="one two"
# enable the tests with tag "one" or "two"
--env grepTags="one two"
# enable the tests with both tags "one" and "two"
--env grepTags="one+two"
# enable the tests with "hello" in the title and tag "smoke"
--env grep=hello,grepTags=smoke
```
