> Filter tests using substring

```shell
# run only tests with "hello" in their names
npx cypress run --env grep=hello

  âœ“ hello world
  - works
  - works 2 @tag1
  - works 2 @tag1 @tag2

  1 passing (38ms)
  3 pending
```

All other tests will be marked pending, see [Cypress test statuses](https://on.cypress.io/writing-and-organizing-tests#Test-statuses)

## Install and use

Assuming you have Cypress installed, add this module as a dev dependency

```shell
# using NPM
npm i -D cypress-grep
# using Yarn
yarn add -D cypress-grep
```

**required:** load this module from the [support file](https://on.cypress.io/writing-and-organizing-tests#Support-file) or at the top of the spec file if not using the support file.

```js
// cypress/support/index.js
// load and register the grep feature
// https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-grep
require('cypress-grep')()
```

**optional:** load and register this module from the [plugin file](https://on.cypress.io/writing-and-organizing-tests#Plugins-file)

```js
// cypress/plugins/index.js
module.exports = (on, config) => {
  // optional: register cypress-grep plugin code
  // https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-grep
  require('cypress-grep/src/plugin')(config)
}
```

The plugin code will print a little message on load, for example

```shell
$ npx cypress run --env grep=hello
cypress-grep: only running tests with "hello" in their names
```

## Filter by grep

You can use any way to modify the environment value `grep` except the run-time `Cypress.env('grep')` (because it is too late at run-time). You can set the `grep` value in the `cypress.json` file to run only tests with the substring `@smoke` in their names

```json
{
  "env": {
    "grep": "@smoke"
  }
}
```

You can also set the `env.grep` object in the plugin file, but remember to return the changed config object:

```js
// cypress/plugin/index.js
module.exports = (on, config) => {
  config.env.grep = '@smoke'
  return config
}
```

Most likely you will pass the grep string via CLI when launching Cypress

```shell
$ npx cypress run --env grep=@smoke
```
